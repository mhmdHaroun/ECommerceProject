Backend Development Task Implement a RESTful API Endpoint Task: Create a user registration endpoint /register that accepts user details 
(first name, last name, email, phone number, password) and saves them to the database. Requirements: Validate the input data. Hash the password before saving. 
Handle errors and edge cases. Provide appropriate responses (success, validation error, server error). Database Design Task: Design a database schema for a
simple e-commerce application with tables for Users, Products, Orders, and OrderItems. Requirements: Provide an ER diagram. Use SQLAlchemy scripts to create the tables. 
Ensure proper relationships between tables (foreign keys). 2. Front-End Development Task 4. Team Leadership Task Code Review Task: Conduct a code review for a given piece of code (provided as part of the interview).
Requirements: Identify issues or improvements in the code. Provide constructive feedback and suggest improvements. Focus on code quality, readability, and best practices. Task Management Task: Given a project scenario,
create a task breakdown and assign tasks to a hypothetical team. Requirements: Use a project management tool (e.g., Jira, Trello) to create and assign tasks.
Provide a brief explanation of how you would manage the project and ensure timely delivery. Include tasks for front-end, and mobile app development. 
5. Problem-Solving and Algorithmic Task Algorithm Implementation Task: Write a function to find the longest common subsequence between two strings.
Requirements: Optimize for time and space complexity. Handle edge cases. Provide test cases to validate the solution. 6. Testing and Quality Assurance Task Write Unit Tests Task
: Write unit tests for the user registration endpoint created in the backend task. Requirements: Use a testing framework 
(e.g., pytest, unittest). Cover various test cases (valid inputs, invalid inputs, edge cases). Ensure tests are easy to understand and maintain.
7. Documentation Task API Documentation Task: Create API documentation for the user registration endpoint. Requirements: Use Postman to document the API.
Include details about request parameters, responses, and error messages. Ensure the documentation is clear and easy to follow. Instructions for the Candidate: Submission: Submit the completed tasks in a GitHub repository
